# Dashjoin Translate

For anyone who needs to translate a webpage or application. Dashjoin Translate allows you to leverage sophisticated machine translation, review and change translations, and deploy them to your project in GDPR compliant way in a matter of minutes. Unlike other solutions, Dashjoin Translate cleanly separates translations from your source code and does not rely on 3rd party services at runtime.

Dashjoin Translate is **free** up to a project limit of 20.000 characters and required **no signup**. To get started, you can translate any public website using our [online service](https://dj-translate-srv-dev-qtmq6xeijq-ey.a.run.app/).

## Translation Menus

This section documents the functionality you use to translate your project.

### Welcome Screen

The welcome screen only requires you to pick one target language. Once you confirm this selection, your project is initialized and the page you currently see is translated into the language you selected. Note that the free version of Dashjoin Translate uses the Google translation service and that the contents of the page will be sent to it.
